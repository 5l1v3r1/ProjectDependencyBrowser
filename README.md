Project Dependency Browser scans a directory for Visual Studio projects and shows their project, assembly and NuGet dependencies in a flexible user interface. The application also provides various filters for example to find projects which depend on a particular NuGet package.

Features: 

- Find all projects which have installed a given NuGet package
- View all referenced assemblies and projects for a given project
- List all projects which reference a given project
- Can be used as solution launcher: Just start it, select project using arrow keys and press enter
- It takes 3 minutes to install and setup the application

**This is a fully working beta version, please provide feedback to improve the application.**

Project Dependency Browser is developed by [Rico Suter](http://rsuter.com) using the [MyToolkit](http://https://github.com/MyToolkit/Core) library.
